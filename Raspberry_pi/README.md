# Run Distance Estimation on Raspberry Pi

## Installation of Opencv-python

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg python3-opencv
```
⚠️ I highly encourage to Build from source, since this module not optimized for Raspberry Pi. 

### Install dependency packages
```
sudo apt install libxcb-shm0 libcdio-paranoia-dev libsdl2-2.0-0 libxv1  libtheora0 libva-drm2 libva-x11-2 libvdpau1 libharfbuzz0b libbluray2 libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-103 libgtk-3-0 libdc1394-22 libopenexr23

```

## ⚠️ Distance Estimation on Pi Camera

> the distance estimation pi_camera is not tested yet, reason I don't have Pi cam 📷 yet, if you have pi cam try confirm that, I would be greatful, 😄 

Thank you so much
